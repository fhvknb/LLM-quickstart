I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

To date we have tried the Oreo, Carrot cake, Pink Cadillac, Carmel Apple Cinnamon, Red Velvet, Banana Foster, Lemon Vanilla Cream, Lemon Raspberry Zest, and Cookie Dough (as you can tell... That's a crap ton of cupcakes and trips on the treadmill lol). The cupcakes are SO moist and delicious! My favorite by far is the Lemon Raspberry, it hasn't been there in a while so the next would be Carmel Apple. Ranking the lowest of all of these would be the Oreo or cookie dough. You also get a BIG cupcake for only $3 and some change compared to other cupcake places. The cupcakes are also able to sit on the counter for 2 days and still be yummy.</td>\n",

With tens of tables free occupied by just a small scattering of young locals and visitors, it made my solo dining experience feel even more lonely.  But it didn't really matter: they have beer, poutine, and hockey on TV.\\n\\nI ordered the Montreal poutine, a standard poutine but topped with smoked meat.  It was good, not great.  The meat didn't really taste like anything or add any flavor to the dish, and the cheese curds stayed pretty solid the whole time.  Fries and gravy were solid though; but I've had better.\\n\\nThe service was fine, no complaints, and for what it is, the price is about right (I probably should have just opted for traditional poutine in retrospect).  I guess this is convenient if you're looking for Poutine downtown and it's part of a chain, which could explain the quality and what not.  It's not good, but it's not bad.

The thing is, he starts his show with like a home movie of getting ready for a show in his home town. It shows him with his wife and kids and how he values his community, so to me he seems like a pretty good guy and the rest is an act - an act that made him very famous and packs them in so he sticks with it. Chances are if you go to this show, you know him and you like his humor.  If you don't just know it is sex jokes, stereotypes and dirty nursery rhymes - it is all harmless.  Like I said I am not sure he believes a word he says, but he knows what make people laugh and he sticks with it.  \\n\\nThe openers were surprisingly good.  His son was still a bit rough, but he has that good looking Dice Jr kind of thing going.  Next up is Eleanor, his ex-fiance and a incredibly funny comedian who pretty much just works the audience to create her act off the interactions.  I would go see her again!  \\n\\nVinyl was good as a comedy venue (rows of seats and a few tables around the stage). The waitress was fine (although a little slow).  The show was really, really short however (which is why I rated it so low).  Maybe 1.5h TOTAL, with Dice being about 35 minutes of that, so if you REALLY want to see him, just know you only get a very short show of Dice, but the show in it's entirety was good.  \\n\\nOh yeah, and as others said, all the comedians pick out people in the audience to ask questions and generally pick on as part of the show, so know if you are close to the stage you might have a target on you!</td>\n",
